## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

As an Ecohydrologist and Water Resources Specialist, my research vision is to promote food and water security in emerging regions through advanced water management solutions. I integrate ground-based measurements, space geodesy, remote sensing, land surface models, physical hydrological models, and AI/machine learning to address hydrological and environmental water management challenges across spatial and temporal scales.
